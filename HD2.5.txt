                                 Hadoop Framework
                                  Assignment 2.5

1)Cluster and Hadoop cluster
        Cluster:
             *Set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that they are treated as a single machine.
             *In simple words, a cluster is a group of machines that work together.
        Hadoop cluster:
             *A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of
                unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.
             *It is a group of machines that work togethe to store and handle very large amounts of data.
             *A large number of nodes are connected with each other, whose details are stored in a namenode.
             *Whenever some data is to be stored, namenode gives the details of free space in the datanodes in which new data can be stored.
             *Likewise,namenode also gives the details of information present in the datanodes in the cluster that is to be retrieved.


2)Components of Hadoop 1.x
           1.Name Node
           2.Secondary name node
           3.Data node
           4.Job tracker
           5.Task Tracker


1.NAME NODE:
      *It holds metadata i.e., information about data present in datanodes.
      * It consists of two important files:
                  1.fsimage:It contains All directory structure of HDFS
                                                 The blocks constituting a file.
                 2.edits: When any read or write operations take place, the directory structure gets modified.
                              These modifications are stored in the memory as well as in edits files .

2.SECONDARY NAME NODE:
     * CHECKPOINTING:If existing fsimage file gets merged with edits, we’ll get an updated fsimage file.
                                        This process is called  Checkpointing
     *Secondary name node takes fsimage and edits files from NameNodeand returns updated fsimagefile after merging.
     *Checkpointing gives the updated information about data nodes in the clusters.
     *Secondary name node helps in updating the namenode every now and then with the current data present in datanodes which helps in 
       effective storage and retrieval of data.
     *But a when a primary name node fails, secondary name node cannot replace it.

3.DATA NODE:
     *It contains the actual data that is  to be stored in HDFS on its own local disk.
     *It has to send periodic signals to namenode to specify that the data node is alive.
     *This is called heart beat signal.
     *When the datanode fails to send periodic signals to the namenode, it treats the data node to be inactive/dead and stops sending any futher data to be 
       stored to that particular datanode.
     *The name node further does not even ask for data retrieval from that particular datanode.It goes to some other datanodes which contain the 
       necessary duplicate data.

4.JobTracker(Not present in Hadoop 2.x)
       *Controls overall execution of map reduce jobs(processing task of data is done by map reduce)

5.TaskTracker(Not present in Hadoop 2.x)
        *Runs individual map reduce jobs on  DataNodes
        *Periodically communicates with the JobTracker to give updates and receive instructions.
